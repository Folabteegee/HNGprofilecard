        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Taiwo Afolabi, a passionate frontend developer with experience in
          creating user-friendly and accessible web applications. My journey
          into web development started with curiosity about how websites work,
          and it has grown into a passion for building digital experiences that
          make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in modern frontend technologies including React, Next.js,
          and TailwindCSS. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new
          design trends, reading tech blogs, or working on personal creative
          projects.

        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          While I'm comfortable with frontend development, there are areas where
          I'm still building confidence:

        <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
        <p>
          Remember why you started this journey - the excitement of seeing your
          code come to life and solve real problems. Don't let imposter syndrome
          hold you back. Every expert was once a beginner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep learning, stay curious, and don't be afraid to ask for help. The
          tech community is incredibly supportive, and collaboration will always
          lead to better outcomes than working in isolation. Stay consistent and
          trust the process.
        </p>

      <section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-extra">
        <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          I believe that great software is built with empathy - understanding
          not just what users want, but why they want it. The best products
          solve real problems in elegant ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm excited about the future of web development, especially with
          advancements in AI, WebAssembly, and new CSS features that continue to
          push what's possible in the browser. The opportunity to create
          meaningful digital experiences that improve people's lives is what
          drives me forward in this field.
